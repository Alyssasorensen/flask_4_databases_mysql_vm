CREATE TABLE patients (
    patient_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE
);

CREATE TABLE medications (
    medication_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    medication_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE patient_medications (
    patient_medication_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    patient_id INT,
    medication_id INT,
    prescribed_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(patient_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (medication_id) REFERENCES medications(medication_id)
);

This will create a clinical database with three tables: patients, medications, and patient_medications. Additionally, there is a foreign key relationship between the patient_medications table and both the patients and medications tables, which is used to link patients with the medications they are prescribed.

The Schema I Chose and Why:

Database Schema:

1.  patients Table:
    patient_id (Primary Key, automatic): A unique identifier for each patient.
    first_name and last_name: Store the patient's first and last names.
    date_of_birth: Records the patient's date of birth.

2.  medications Table:
    medication_id (Primary Key, automatic): A unique identifier for each medication.
    medication_name: Stores the name of the medication.

3.  patient_medications Table:
    patient_medication_id (Primary Key, automatic): A unique identifier for each patient-medication relationship.
    patient_id (Foreign Key, references patients(patient_id)): Links the patient to their prescribed medications.
    medication_id (Foreign Key, references medications(medication_id)): Links the medication to the patients.
    prescribed_date: Records the date when the medication was prescribed to the patient.

My schema allows me to associate patients with the medications they are prescribed. The patient_id and medication_id fields in the patient_medications table create a foreign key relationship with the patients and medications tables, respectively, establishing the connection between patients and their prescribed medications.
